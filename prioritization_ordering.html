As Product Managers, one of our most valuable tools isn‚Äôt a roadmap or a fancy toolset‚Äîit‚Äôs the ability to prioritize and order effectively. When building great products, it‚Äôs not just about what gets done, but when and why.<br>

<h5>üîç Why Prioritization Matters</h5><br><br>
At any given time, a product team juggles multiple initiatives‚Äîcustomer asks, technical debts, business goals, regulatory requirements. Without a strong framework for prioritization, we risk spreading our teams thin or shipping features that don‚Äôt drive real value.
<br>
Prioritization helps us:
<br>

Focus on high-impact work <br>
Say no (or ‚Äúnot yet‚Äù) to less critical items <br>
Align cross-functional teams on what matters most <br><br>

<b>üß∞ Frameworks I Use </b> <br>
Here are some of the most effective frameworks I‚Äôve used over time:<br>

1. RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)<br>
Helps in evaluating features with a data-backed approach. I often use this during quarterly planning to sort through a backlog of ideas.<br>

2. MoSCoW (Must, Should, Could, Won‚Äôt)<br>
Great during sprint planning or when aligning stakeholders on delivery expectations.<br>

3. Kano Model<br>
Useful when designing user-centric features. It helps identify delight vs. baseline expectations.<br>

<b>üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Example from My Experience</b><br>
While working at b.well Connected Health, we were considering several improvements to our care navigation experience. We had customer feedback, engineering ideas, and partner feature requests all at once.

I initiated a RICE scoring session with cross-functional input‚Äîour top feature scored high on ‚ÄúReach‚Äù and ‚ÄúImpact‚Äù but needed a bit more effort than the others. Instead of choosing a low-effort win, we prioritized the higher-impact feature: integrating dynamic care plan recommendations.

The result? Not only did we boost user engagement by 20%, but we also received positive feedback from one of our key enterprise clients, validating that prioritization can be both strategic and empathetic.
<br>
<b>üìà Final Thoughts</b><br><br>
Prioritization isn‚Äôt a one-time task‚Äîit‚Äôs a continuous cycle of listening, analyzing, and adapting. The best Product Managers don‚Äôt just prioritize based on intuition; they use data, collaborate with stakeholders, and always keep the user at the center.

Next time you‚Äôre overwhelmed with requests, ask yourself: What will move the needle now, and what can wait?

Let your priorities speak louder than your plans.


 
 

       <!--  <div id="sliding-div">
            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
            <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
